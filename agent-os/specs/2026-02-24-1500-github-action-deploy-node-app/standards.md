# Standards for GitHub Action Deploy Node App

The following standards apply to this work.

---

## global/coding-style

Applies to all code written (Express app, tests, workflow YAML). Keep code clean and readable for demo purposes.

---

## global/error-handling

Applies to the Express app — basic error handling for unknown routes and server errors.

---

## testing/test-writing

Applies to Jest tests — follow testing conventions for clear, descriptive test names and proper assertions.

---

## Note

Since this is a demo project focused on showcasing Agent OS teams and Chrome debugging, standards are applied lightly. The priority is clarity and demo-ability over production rigor.
